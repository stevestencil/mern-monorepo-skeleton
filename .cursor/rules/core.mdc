# Project-wide Conventions
- Use TypeScript strict mode everywhere.
- Prefer functional, small modules. Avoid long classes.
- Always write a short JSDoc for exported functions and types.
- Do not hardcode env secrets; read from process.env with typed helpers.

# Tasks
- `pnpm dev`: run all dev servers (web + api).
- `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` use Turborepo.

# Files & Paths
- Shared code is in `packages/shared`. Import with `@shared/*` path alias.

# Commit Hygiene
- Keep PRs small. Add/adjust tests with code changes.
