# Security

- Never commit .env or secrets. Provide .env.example.
- Use Helmet, CORS on API. Validate inputs with Zod.
- Sanitize outputs; avoid echoing raw error messages.

# Env Documentation

- Do not commit secrets. Local `.env` files are gitignored.
- When adding sensitive env vars, provide safe placeholders and document them in `README.md`.

# Comprehensive Documentation

- **Security Best Practices**: See `docs/SECURITY.md` for comprehensive security guidelines, vulnerability reporting, and security checklist.
- **Architecture Security**: See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for security considerations in the monorepo structure.
- **Development Security**: See `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for security patterns in API and frontend development.
