# Security

- Never commit .env or secrets. Provide .env.example.
- Use Helmet, CORS on API. Validate inputs with Zod.
- Sanitize outputs; avoid echoing raw error messages.
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints.
- Use HTTPS in production; enforce secure headers.
- Validate file uploads with type checking and size limits.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization middleware.
- Use environment-specific CORS configurations.
- Implement proper session management and secure cookies.
- Use proper password hashing (bcrypt, scrypt, or argon2).
- Implement proper CSRF protection.
- Use proper XSS protection with Content Security Policy.
- Implement proper SQL injection protection with parameterized queries.
- Use proper input validation and sanitization.
- Implement proper logging for security events.

# Env Documentation

- Do not commit secrets. Local `.env` files are gitignored.
- When adding sensitive env vars, provide safe placeholders and document them in `README.md`.

# Comprehensive Documentation

- **Security Best Practices**: See `docs/SECURITY.md` for comprehensive security guidelines, vulnerability reporting, and security checklist.
- **Architecture Security**: See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for security considerations in the monorepo structure.
