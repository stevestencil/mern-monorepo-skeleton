# React Rules

- Use React Router for pages in `src/routes/*`.
- Use TanStack Query for server state. Never fetch in useEffect directly.
- Centralize API calls in `src/api.ts`. Always throw on non-2xx.

# Components

- Keep pages thin; extract components when they exceed ~100 lines.

# API Integration

- Use React 19 with Vite; prefer `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching.
- Read API base from `VITE_API_BASE`; keep default in `README.md` synced with code.
- If routes, paths, or error envelope change, update `apps/web/src/api.ts` and the `README.md` examples.
- Document any new env vars or flags.

# Comprehensive Documentation

- **Frontend Development**: See `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for detailed React patterns, component structure, custom hooks, and API client examples.
- **Architecture**: See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for frontend design patterns, performance optimization, and security considerations.
- **Security**: See `docs/SECURITY.md` for frontend security best practices and XSS prevention.
