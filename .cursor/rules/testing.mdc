# Testing

- Use Vitest everywhere. On web, use Testing Library.
- Strive for fast unit tests; mock network and DB where possible.
- Put tests in `__tests__` close to source.

# CI & Docs

- Use Vitest across workspaces. Keep `pnpm test` green.
- If test commands or coverage settings change, reflect them in `README.md` where relevant.
