# Testing

- Use Vitest everywhere. On web, use Testing Library.
- Strive for fast unit tests; mock network and DB where possible.
- Put tests in `__tests__` close to source.

# CI & Docs

- Use Vitest across workspaces. Keep `pnpm test` green.
- If test commands or coverage settings change, reflect them in `README.md` where relevant.

# Comprehensive Documentation

- **Testing Patterns**: See `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for detailed testing examples, API testing with Supertest, and component testing patterns.
- **Architecture Testing**: See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for testing considerations in the monorepo structure.
- **Contributing**: See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for testing requirements and standards.
