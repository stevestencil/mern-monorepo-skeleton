## Package.json Scripts

The project includes convenient npm scripts that wrap the helper scripts:

### AI Agent Scripts

```bash
# Create new feature branch
pnpm ai:new-feature <name>

# Check project setup
pnpm ai:check-setup

# Run health checks
pnpm ai:check-health

# Prepare for deployment
pnpm ai:deploy-ready

# Clean project
pnpm ai:clean
```

### Workflow Scripts

```bash
# AI agent workflow
pnpm workflow:ai

# User development workflow
pnpm workflow:user

pnpm workflow:qa

# Deploy workflow
pnpm workflow:deploy
```

## Best Practices

### For AI Agents

1. **Always use the AI workflow**:

   ```bash
   pnpm workflow:ai
   ```

2. **Check health before starting**:

   ```bash
   pnpm ai:check-health
   ```

3. **Create feature branches**:

   ```bash
   pnpm ai:new-feature feature-name
   ```

4. **Verify quality before completion**:
   ```bash
   pnpm workflow:qa
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Start with user workflow**:

   ```bash
   pnpm workflow:user
   ```

2. **Use quality assurance**:

   ```bash
   pnpm workflow:qa
   ```

3. **Prepare for deployment**:
   ```bash
   pnpm workflow:deploy
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission denied**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

3. **Node.js version mismatch**:

   ```bash
   nvm use 20.11.0
   ```

4. **Script not found**:
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the project root
   ls -la scripts/
   ```

### Getting Help

```bash
# Show help for AI helper
./scripts/ai-dev-helper.sh help

# Show help for workflow
./scripts/dev-workflow.sh help
```

## Examples

### Complete AI Agent Workflow

```bash
# 1. Check project health
