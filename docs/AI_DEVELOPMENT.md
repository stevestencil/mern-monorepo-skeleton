# AI-Assisted Development Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for AI agents working with this MERN monorepo project, especially when assisting users with little to no coding knowledge to build real applications.

## Project Overview

This is a **production-ready MERN monorepo** designed for AI-assisted development:

- **Backend**: Express.js API with MongoDB
- **Frontend**: React 19 with Vite
- **Shared**: TypeScript types and Zod schemas
- **Testing**: Vitest with 80% coverage requirement
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with `any` type forbidden

## Getting Started with User Requirements

### Development Workflow

#### Before Making Changes

1. **Understand the request**: Ask clarifying questions
2. **Check existing code**: Look for similar patterns
3. **Plan the implementation**: Break down into steps
4. **Get user approval**: Confirm the plan before starting

#### During Implementation

1. **Follow the rules**: Check `.cursor/rules/` for guidance
2. **Write tests first**: TDD approach for new features
3. **Use TypeScript strictly**: No `any` types
4. **Follow naming conventions**: Check existing patterns
5. **Update documentation**: README.md and relevant docs

#### After Implementation

1. **Run tests**: `pnpm test` to ensure everything works
2. **Check linting**: `pnpm lint` for code quality
3. **Type check**: `pnpm typecheck` for TypeScript errors
4. **Verify functionality**: Test the feature works as expected
5. **Update docs**: Document any new setup or usage

### Error Handling Patterns

#### When You Encounter Errors

1. **Check the logs**: Use structured logging to identify issues
2. **Validate inputs**: Ensure all inputs match Zod schemas
3. **Check database connection**: Verify MongoDB connectivity
4. **Review environment variables**: Ensure all required vars are set
5. **Run tests**: Use `pnpm test` to identify failing tests

#### Common Error Patterns

- **Validation errors** → Check Zod schemas in shared package
- **Database errors** → Check MongoDB connection and models
- **Type errors** → Ensure strict TypeScript compliance
- **Test failures** → Check test setup and mocks
- **Build errors** → Check TypeScript configuration and imports

### Testing Requirements

#### Mandatory Testing

- **All new code must include tests**
- **80% coverage minimum** for branches, functions, lines, and statements
- **Unit tests** for individual functions and components
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints and component interactions
- **Error scenarios** must be tested, not just happy paths

#### Test Structure

```
src/
├── __tests__/
│   ├── setup.ts          # Test configuration and mocks
│   ├── lib/              # Unit tests for utilities
│   ├── components/       # Component tests
│   └── integration/      # Integration tests
```

#### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run integration tests
pnpm test:integration
```

### Code Quality Standards

#### TypeScript Requirements

- **Strict mode**: All TypeScript code must use strict mode
- **No `any` type**: The `any` type is forbidden throughout the codebase
- **Type safety**: All functions and variables must be properly typed
- **JSDoc comments**: All exported functions and types must have JSDoc documentation

#### Code Organization

- **Functional approach**: Prefer functional, small modules over large classes
- **Single responsibility**: Each module should have a single, clear purpose
- **File naming**: Use kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- **Import organization**: Use consistent import ordering (external, internal, relative)

#### File Size Limits

- **Functions**: Should not exceed 50 lines
- **Files**: Should not exceed 300 lines
- **Components**: Keep focused and extract when needed

### Documentation Requirements

#### When Adding Features

- **Update README.md** if setup or usage changes
- **Document API endpoints** with request/response examples
- **Document environment variables** with defaults
- **Update architecture docs** if structure changes

#### When Fixing Bugs

- **Document the root cause** in commit messages
- **Add tests** to prevent regression
- **Update troubleshooting docs** if it's a common issue

### Security Considerations

#### Always Validate

- **Input validation**: Use Zod schemas for all inputs
- **Environment variables**: Validate with Zod schemas
- **Database queries**: Use Mongoose's built-in protection
- **Error messages**: Never expose sensitive information

#### Security Checklist

- [ ] Input validation with Zod
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Environment variable validation
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Security headers with Helmet

### Performance Considerations

#### API Performance

- **Database indexing** for frequently queried fields
- **Connection pooling** for MongoDB
- **Response compression** with Express
- **Caching** for expensive operations

#### Frontend Performance

- **Code splitting** with dynamic imports
- **Lazy loading** for routes and components
- **Memoization** with React.memo and useMemo
- **Bundle optimization** with Vite

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues

1. **TypeScript errors**: Check strict mode compliance
2. **Test failures**: Verify test setup and mocks
3. **Build errors**: Check imports and dependencies
4. **Database connection**: Verify MongoDB URI and connection
5. **Environment variables**: Ensure all required vars are set

#### Debugging Steps

1. **Check logs**: Use structured logging to identify issues
2. **Run tests**: Use `pnpm test` to identify failing tests
3. **Type check**: Use `pnpm typecheck` for TypeScript errors
4. **Lint check**: Use `pnpm lint` for code quality issues
5. **Build check**: Use `pnpm build` to verify build process
